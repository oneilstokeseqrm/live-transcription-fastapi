  "text": "A: Hey, folks. How's everybody doing?\nB: Good.\nC: How about yourself?\nA: Great. Great. I'll be. Apologies for not being on video. I'll be on in a couple minutes. I know. Let's see. Jackie, I'll make sure we introduce you in a minute. I think LIOR is planning to join too, but I don't. Greg, anyone else from your side? I see you and Rob and Revali and it looks like. I think there were a couple other folks, but not sure.\nC: I think Brendan's off. Right, Rob?\nD: Brendan is off. He asked that we record the session.\nE: Yeah, let me make sure I have that.\nD: But Dave is. I was just on a meeting with Dave.\nC: Yeah, there he is.\nA: Hey, Dave.\nC: Hey, Dave.\nA: Let me just check in with Lior real quick too, but then we'll get started.\nE: Hey, once we start, I will start the recording and then I will share it with the team.\nB: Sounds good.\nA: All right, give me just. We'll do one more second, then we'll get started. I see Lior's here now too. Amazing. Yeah. All right.\nD: How was it?\nA: I'll be on video in a minute. Let's see. I figured to get started, we'll let Jackie introduce herself from the AWS side and then we might go around the lighting in progress. There we go. Nice. We might go around the Lightbox side too, just to make sure Jackie has some context on the team. And then we'll dive into talking about AML and I'll let Jackie take over.\nB: Sure thing. I'll introduce myself. So I'm Jackie Rusk. I'm a technical business development manager for our program here at aws. We're called the Application Modernization Lab. This is an invite only program. So you will are definitely federal customers and we are focused on customers that have heavy EC2, Windows, SQL Server and Oracle RDS workloads running on AWS Currently or planning to move to aws. We want to help those customers modernize to cloud native and cloud optimized technologies. Plan today is really for me to provide an overview of the program, the things we do well, the things we like to focus on. An overview of how the program functions and some of the requirements around it. But also I really want to hear from you all about sort of where your modernization priorities lie. The things that are really top of mind to Lightbox. So that's who I am. Great.\nC: Nice to meet you.\nB: Great to meet you all.\nC: I guess I'll go next. So I'm Greg Arpino. I'm the director of finops at Lightbox. You know, part of. Part of My job is managing, overseeing and managing the cost of aws. Obviously, AWS is one of our. Our largest, largest operational costs next to salaries. And so it's, you know, it's something we pay careful attention to. So I monitor and, you know, keep an eye on the cost for AWS.\nD: Next. Rob Riley, director of DevOps architecture at Lightbox, are really right now involved in four migrations that we're doing from on Prem to the cloud that are all Windows based.\nB: Very good. Awesome. Then relevant content we'll cover off on today.\nD: Exactly.\nC: Sorry about that.\nA: Dave Kaplan, VP of Infrastructure Engineering. I cover all of the infrastructure, database.\nC: And incident management functions on the team.\nE: Thank you, David. I'll go next. Ranga Kondapalli. I'm the director of Database Ops. And what are projects which are ongoing for migration? I think Vero. Database involved. We are involved.\nB: Great to meet you.\nE: Oh, nice to meet you too. Thanks.\nA: Okay. I did a poor job of setting the stage because I was making my way between places. So we've worked with Jackie internally. We're very familiar with AML as a program and Jackie, I let you know, but we were able to share a little bit about AML with the team and really that's all we've done. I think we're kind of starting from the top here. But what I did share with everyone and what I guess the account team shared with everyone, broadly speaking, is just that we, you know, to me, AML is one of the more compelling programs that we offer up at aws. It's not accessible to everyone. You mentioned it's invite only, but it's, you know, it's more than that. Right. Like the, I think the profile of the customer, the stage in their journey, and then like, to a certain extent, I think like the kind of the mutual commitment that's already ongoing.\nC: Right.\nA: I mean, like, we already have a deep partnership with Lightbox. We meet with the. The team on a really regular basis. So, yeah, that's. But that's all we've really covered other than that. I think starting from close to scratch might be helpful, especially because you're relying on me to have conveyed the right information. And I don't know that that was a smart thing to do.\nB: If you got us about 80% of the way there, I can get this the rest of the way. So appreciate the introduction and looking forward to learning a little bit more about Lightbox and your priorities. Like I said about modernization. Spent a lot of my career doing projects with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. Multifamily and so your mission around real estate data is near and dear to my own passions and history here. So looking forward to hearing a little bit more about your priorities. But first we can just do a brief overview of the program itself, how it works, some of the details of it. What we can offer can also then pivot quickly on the back half of this conversation again around Lightbox's priorities where you all have opportunities for modernization. So is there anything else folks want to get out of this meeting before I dig in? Sounds good.\nA: Sorry. Shoot. I got to mention one thing. Mostly because I felt Greg sold himself a little short, but I was just going to say we, you know we work with a small handful of digital native customers, right. And like not it's not always common to have folks on the phone who kind of under like to have the, you know, the financial perspective and the technical perspective on the call. And like I think as far as tailoring to the audience goes like we're, you know, we're fortunate that we have that here. So it's just helpful context that I probably should have shared in advance.\nB: No, appreciate that and again appreciate the context and glad that we could get everyone on the call here. I'm going to go ahead and share my screen so let me know when you all can see. Okay, super. So like I said Application Modernization Lab what's a little bit unique about this program is like Peter said, we are an invite only program. We are really focused at customers that have very large Windows and SQL Server heavy workloads and we are also a cost neutral program which means the customer does come away at a net zero impact as you make your way through this program. And really what we were focused on when we were created about four years ago was again making a better experience for customers running again those EC2 Windows, SQL Server and Oracle RDS workloads. Making sure you all are getting a cloud optimized experience and that post migration cloud journey continues with AWS as a strategic partner to help you all achieve your objectives. In terms of cloud optimization we can focus on a couple of different things or really what we bring here is learning, benefits and incentives, a dedicated solution architect that only works in the types of modernizations that I've mentioned. A hands on Proserve 8 week lab engagement with each with each AML engagement that has started as well as DIY do it yourself modernization, support, resources and again I'll provide an overview of the nuances of what we cover here. But really what you want to I want to cover with you today is like the who, what, when, where, why and how much right of the AML program. So like I said, invite only, only available to about the top 500AML or AWS customers in terms of EC2, Windows and SQL Server. So Lightbox, really looking forward to hearing about your work again. What do we do? What we do with you is help you with your modernization priorities. We can be very flexible in the way that we run our lab engagements and we want to hear again about what your priorities are in terms of where. Typically we run into virtual model, but we can do on sites as part of our technical discovery phase of this engagement. In terms of when we've got, you know, we've got solution architects that are available as soon as you are ready to go and as soon as your teams are interested in kicking off an AML engagement. In terms of the how here again we can operate in a couple different ways. One, if there is a need and a desire for upskilling teaching and understanding in a lab setting, we can really focus on a learning and enablement style of lab. But that being said, if you've got really experienced engineers, really experienced database specialists, we can also operate in more of a consultative let's just get this done, let's leverage this pod, let's leverage these resources to kick off a foundational and impactful piece of our modernization. Or we can operate with you all in a bit more of a hybrid fast and the how much. Glad we've got the finops folks on the line here who care about the numbers. So all in, it's going to be 497 in terms of financial commitments. That being said, like I said, it is a cost neutral program. As customers work through the AML journey, there are service credits that are refunded back to customers as you hit certain milestones through the program. And I'm going to provide an overview of exactly when you can expect those to really those cash flows to come out and the service credits to come back to you all. But that's really what I want to cover off on today in the next 15ish minutes. Okay, so the way that we operate, it sounds like you all one have some workloads that are currently running on aws. I've got some insight there in terms of what's already running on aws and we really focus in on portfolio modernization for things that have land on the cloud. That being said, we also understand that customers have different phases of their cloud journey. We want to understand your migrations for your EC2, Windows SQL Server and Oracle RDS workloads so that we can help you sequence or plan for modernizations for those workloads as they land on aws. And also we understand that a lot of our customers are talking about Gen AI, talking about unlocking data assets. Data is your business. So we also want to understand if you've got priorities right now that are locked up by legacy architectures, this is a good opportunity for us to help you get ahead of those Gen AI priorities and really leverage this modernization lab to invest and kind of get unlock those data assets so that you can prioritize in those types of activities. We can again run in a couple of different formats. One, we can focus in on one specific application where we just get really deep on one application, but also depending on the size of the workloads that are getting migrated into aws, we can also operate in a portfolio management or sort of a portfolio assessment approach where we look comprehensively at all of your EC2 windows and SQL Server workloads and help you prioritize modern modernization projects or many AMLs tied to this program and help you sequence sort of what an overall portfolio strategy roadmap looks like. But what we can also do is just focus in on the application level if you're really just focused in on one or two specific core applications. Wanted to highlight that this is an option, but again, application and portfolio assessment, we can operate in a couple different flavors as well. In terms of what we do, what we consider to be our bread and butter. As you see here, we've got a lot of different modernization pathways that our solution architects want to talk about with you all on the left hand side of your screen modernization pathways number one and number two, those are going to be what we consider our qualifying workloads. So the way that you qualify into an AML engagement is by tagging $1 million of EC2 Windows or SQL Server. And that's going to be your qualifying metric to unlock. Now we're going to help you define pathways to do a. NET modernization to move you to NET Core, to enable you to move from EC2 Windows to Linux. Or if again database is your priority, if you've got EC2 SQL or RDS SQL, SQL Byll, we can dig into that and help you find strategies and pathways to get you into Aurora and other AWS purpose built databases. That's what we consider our qualifying modernization pathways. But as we get into technical discovery for your targeted workloads, it's not where we're going to limit our conversation and our analysis and our Target architecture definition. We want to understand where your priorities lay in microservice technology, containerization of your applications and serverless priorities as well. Also, something here to consider is tied to DevOps, right, your DevOps processes. I understand that you all kind of have grown over the years through several migrations. Often what we see with our customers that have, or sorry, acquisitions, what we see from a lot of our customers that have had a lot of recent or kind of near recent acquisitions as pipeline management and pipeline rationalization can be a priority. So we want to work with you all to better understand what your DevOps modernization priorities are as well as we're considering this top to bottom application modernization priorities. So this is what we mean and this is what our solution architects in the AML program will focus in on with your teams to define a target architecture through the lab process. Any questions so far or thoughts, especially in terms of priorities of your modernization needs?\nC: So if I'm understanding correctly, it sounds like you're using the term modernization really to move towards open source, to move away from vendor specific products, in this case Microsoft and Oracle, onto a more open source architecture. I mean, I don't necessarily consider Oracle and Microsoft to not be modern, but I think, you know, I see the point of moving towards more of a, you know, of an open source type of type of architecture. So that my understanding that correctly.\nB: Yeah, I think that. Right. Our pathways of moving to the open source technologies is definitely an outcome of our AML program. That being said, when we talk about modernization, there may be other things that you want to get done within your applications and your databases through this lab that aren't just tied to getting to open source. Right. You know, like if you've got a monolithic structure, we can support you all in coming up with strategies to decompose the monolith so that you've got, you know, more independent services. It's easier to manage. You can rationalize legacy functions within the monolith and deprecate that legacy code. There are modernization strategies beyond just moving to open source. But if these are your priorities, again that's where we want to understand. Is it just moving to open source that you're interested in? Are you interested in that? Or are there other outcomes that Lightbox is looking for in your current EC2 Windows and SQL Server footprint on AWS?\nD: Yeah, so like currently we are working on just getting some migrations done to move them over the aws, but I can think of like one off top of my head would be rems, which, you know, our Plan was to actually do that modernization first and migrate to AWS at the same time. Because that workload roads on Broadcom's VMware. We actually are now just looking to do a migration assistant lift and shift, just get it off the Broadcom hardware, get it into aws. And that engineering team is very ready to do a modernization of that application. Yeah, I think some of it would be. Is more. They've already started taking a look at it. What can they run on the newer versions of. NET so they can run it on Linux. Some of it is like the web front end is much older and it's going to require a lot more resources to sort of get that, you know, modernized.\nB: What, what technology stack is the web front end running on?\nD: I heard Visual Basic and ASP.\nB: Okay.\nD: Web forms.\nB: ASP web forms. Okay. And web forms asp.net okay, sounds good. Definitely common, especially on run end technologies. That's usually what we're hearing on some of our legacy applications for other customers as well. Just made a note of that. But that sounds like something that we've tackled before in an AML engagement as well.\nD: Then the other three are all much, considerably smaller applications, but still are all NET MSSQL.\nB: Okay.\nD: And that's for things that we're currently migrating. And then we have a bunch of workloads that are still legacy workloads using. NET and Ms. SQL that are already running in aws. And we sort of have to go through them and figure out. Because some of them we already have plans on sort of rewriting using, you know, microservices and things like that. Yeah, so that was, you know, would be a good candidate where others are, you know, there may not be a plan for that right now.\nB: Gotcha. In terms of the stuff that's running on Ms. SQL, I do see some of it EC2 that you all have. Do you have BYOL in terms of your BYOL structure?\nC: Okay, some of it, yeah, yeah. Some of it is byol. Some of it is the. We've used the AWS image, so we're paying the license fee. And obviously the rds, it doesn't support byol. So that's all included. One of the things we have looked at though in some of the SQL servers that we're looking to move into, AWS is doing RDS custom so that we can do. Bring your own media.\nE: I've been using some of those already. But.\nD: Then I think some of the other difficulties we've had. Correct me if I'm wrong, Ranga, with moving off some of the Ms. SQLs is the Geospatial functionality.\nE: Yes. Especially when we consider moving it from SQL Server to postgres like this across cross database server migration. We did have significant issues with and we didn't really find a solution. We had quite a few meeting with AWS tech teams and experts. But yeah, that's a problem. Correct?\nB: Yeah, definitely understand Geospatial is a pretty critical set of functionality for you all just based off of your business. So definitely would need to find some solutions that work well. If moving away from SQL is a priority that you all have or are interested in kind of further evaluating for sure. Question on the licensing side is licensing, I think that you all are concerned about is it. Is it, you know, a piece of your, you know, something that you're looking to do away with if possible or is it something that's not a priority and it's really about the functionality that your databases have around that it's something.\nC: Where it makes sense and it doesn't put the business at risk, you know, and where it makes cost sense. It's certainly something that we, you know, we want to be aware of. We have invested a lot in SQL Server licensing over the years. We have a number of licenses that we, that we own and that we're paying, you know, you know, we're paying support on and you know, if it's possible to reuse those, we'd like to understand how we could. But I think in a lot of cases, a lot of those licenses or Windows or Windows Enterprise licenses, which there's no real option to BYOL in AWS on those, the only thing we can really theoretically BYOL at this point would be like our SQL Server.\nE: I'll add a little bit more to that because I've done some recent comparisons there, Greg, in the context of our RCM migration, I did a comparison for byol, especially in the context of RDS custom. The savings are significant, especially for Enterprise Edition.\nC: For Enterprise Edition. Yeah, yeah. For Enterprise Edition.\nE: Yeah. It's almost like one third cost of the going for a RDS instance.\nC: Yeah. And I had that conversation with Rick Chang on the RCM side as well. To the extent that they're looking to.\nE: Use Enterprise Edition Enterprise Edition, I think we have licenses. Only thing is Cross Edition. How much does it carry or can we use the like for example, we're at some version now and future we are going to some other. Those are the things we need to figure out.\nC: Yeah. And one of the things we do want to evaluate and as part of this would be worth evaluating is whether we need Enterprise Edition. You know, in certain cases I understand we do, but talking through with Rick on it, it sounds like they really don't necessarily need it on the RCM.\nE: Side from a feature that's that's still under evaluation, it's an off site, it's an, you know, we can take the conversation off. From a features perspective, yes, you are right. But from a powering perspective from a resource that is still to be verified.\nC: Yeah. My point being that these are things we need to look at.\nA: Okay.\nE: Yeah, awesome.\nB: Good, thanks. Really appreciate the brief conversation around licensing. It's something that a lot of our customers want to understand a little bit more and it's often a priority so it's good context bringing it back to sort of how AML supports Again these are the kinds of conversations the prioritization of features versus cost optimization. These are the things we can also explore through the technical discovery. So but really these are the things that are our solution architects and our delivery teams do really well is modernization of these types of workloads and really considering it's part of architecture that is aligned with Lightbox or customers objectives. So I want to give you all an overview of the way that one AML standard eight week lab works. So what would happen is if we collaboratively work together, you all identify a workload that is a million dollars of EC2 Windows or SQL Server ARR. That is by the way what we would do then is collaboratively start on what is our AML Technical Discovery phase. Now this is the first phase of the AML engagement and it is free of cost. There is no cost associated with committing to and being a part of the AML Technical discovery. All we really ask is that a customer says hey, I like the idea of this program. We're planning on using this lab function and we're ready to start talking to you all and talking to one of your solution architects about designing a cloud native architecture for one of our applications that is business critical importance to us for modernization. The way that our AML technical discoveries work. AML solution architects specialized only in these types of modernizations would run a series of workshops with your team, your engineers, your database experts, anyone from the application side that needs to be a part of the conversation and key decision makers and what they're going to do is run a series of workshops. This can either be done as an on site, you know, three full days we'll call it or remotely with a series of six to eight two hour sessions with your teams over the course of one to two months and we're going to dig in with you, we're going to understand your current pain points of that application, we're going to understand what your target priorities look like and your modernization outcomes look like. We're going to do code reviews and database schema reviews and collaboratively kind of document that legacy Microsoft or legacy SQL architecture and work with you all to define a cloud native cloud optimized architecture that really kind of gets you all moving into the modernization direction that you're looking to achieve. Now the AML Engagement Specification, that's the document that comes out of the AML Technical Discovery. It's going to document your current state, the collaboratively aligned upon market state architecture as well as a series of outcomes that you all are looking to achieve in the hands on proserve delivered lab. That engagement specifications reviewed by your teams aligned on approved and only at that point at the conclusion of the AML Technical Discovery would you receive a statement of work for that Pro Serve delivery podcast. Hands on delivery Lab to onboard. Now one other cool benefit of the AML is that you do get 15 seats of architecting with AWS. That's a three day AWS classroom based training delivered digitally, but classroom based training to support your engineers to work towards a AWS certified Solution Architect certification. So again that would be a cost neutral benefit. So wanted to highlight that nice little deal sweetener as well. Now coming out of the AML Technical Discovery again so far free of charge, only at the end of it are you getting a statement of work. That's when we move into the AML Phase 1 modernization lab. This is an eight week lab that is delivered by the AWS Proserve team Professional services and what you're going to get here is 190 person days or approximately four to five Proserve consultants that onboard into your environment for eight weeks. They are going to be dedicated to your teams. They'll onboard into your environment, work alongside your teams, work within your tooling to start to make progress on the cloud native architecture that was defined in Technical Discovery and work on that lab scope that was defined in Technical Discovery. They're going to bring their expertise in these types of modernizations as well as modernization at scale tooling that is either developed by AWS or proprietary to professional services as well as kind of bringing that best practices and sort of best knowledge or expert knowledge to support your teams in kicking off this modernization. So it's going to be eight weeks, four to five proserve Consultants fully engaged, operating alongside your teams and within your tooling coming out of that phase. One modernization lab. That's when customers get their first service credit payment. So it's going to be 50% of the cost of the pro served. Billings that are incurred during this hands on delivery lab are immediately coming back to our customers at the conclusion of the hands on lab as well as the cost of the training comes back right at the conclusion of the hands on lab. Now those eight weeks are meant to set in motion an accelerated modernization pathway for your team. Hands on support so you've got tangible progress, something that is like an MVP for your teams of that modernized architecture so that you're happy, so that you have in hand one tangible progress but also an AML roadmap that that outlines the additional steps to take and the path forward for your teams to complete the modernization that was defined in the technical discovery in our third phase, which is the DIY or do it yourself modernization phase. This DIY phase is going to be when the customer teams take on the modernization project that was started in the hands on lab and work on it through completion until it's pushed into production. Now that being said, our team continues to stay in contact and provide post lab support and guidance. Our solution architects would be meeting with your teams bimonthly to provide architectural and advisory support if there is additional research needed on your solution. If you're encountering an issue with the architecture and something needs to be reworked, that architect is going to be available to you all to help troubleshoot those issues and find pathways forward. Additionally, we'll have monthly health checks with the entire project team run by myself as a BDM where we're going to be keeping tabs on risks, issues, blockers that are coming up on your side that AWS can find pathways forward to. Now the supplement service credit that comes back to customers happens when you hit the modernization complete for your workload. And we measure that through tagging of that legacy workload. When we see the legacy resources deprecated by 75%, that's when we consider that workload to be modernization complete. We recognize that when you're looking at an application or a workload, not every single resource or instance is going to be deprecated. There may be things that for whatever reason just aren't worth the ROI to invest in modernization or have to stay put depending on customer commitments. So that 75% EC2 Windows or SQL Server reduction for the targeted workload is that second trigger point so that you recoup the remainder of anything that's paid out and you get that back through service credits. So overall this program typically takes customers between 6 to 15 months depending on the complexity of the architecture, the resources committed and the modernization pathway that's defined in technical discovery. So what's unique here about this program is again this cost neutrality as well as that hands on proserve lab support and the long running support that customers get through the phase two DIY progress. I'm going to pause right here to see what questions folks might have about the way that AML operates.\nD: No questions. I just think I'm wondering if we have any single workload that would cross that million dollar threshold. Is RIMS there? Greg, I think you on zoom on that. I wasn't sure if it was.\nC: Yes, I just pinged you back on it. But it's, it's not, it's not quite there. Between the VMC and the native, other native AWS charges, it's close.\nD: Is that it's on demand cost or is that after edp?\nC: No, that would be after EDP and after any reservations and savings plans, things like that.\nD: Do you guys take that into consideration? Do you take the percentage it would cost in EDP or do you take that all out when you're looking at that million dollar figure?\nB: So we look at usage, we look at the usage that is billed for the previous, you know, three months. So if you all are close, you know, if you all are close we can, we can connect on it and kind of figure out what we've done in the past is if it's 800k or above, we can do like a prorated lab where there's maybe slightly fewer hours associated with it. Another thing to consider is if there are two workloads that are of similar patterns or where you can take the learnings of an AML lab and apply it to both problem sets. That's another way that some customers we.\nD: Can definitely get there. That's not a problem.\nC: Yeah, so. So rims, the trick with RIMS would be that the latest, the latest cost of the VMC wasn't built by AWS because they can no longer carry that lead to Broadcom. So that won't show up, you know, is.\nD: But, but with that shift at first. So it will be running in AWS soon.\nC: Yes, correct. And I think once it's in AWS it's not going to be $1 million workload. SSLV and data platform are probably are.\nD: Yeah.\nB: Question for you all on the rims, is it RIMS application? Yeah, when are you all expecting that to land on aws?\nD: So it has to be off of the VMC by May of next year. So we literally just met last week, made the decision to stop the modernization effort because we're just running out of time.\nB: Yeah.\nD: To do the lift and shift. So we have a planning meeting on that literally this week. The next step will probably be we will start spinning up non production workloads in that account and then we'll start testing the failover of the lower environments with planning. We're doing that for the production environment.\nC: And Jack, it is running in aws, but it's running on VMC in aws. And we're also using a lot of the native aws. You know, there's like FSX and some other stuff, native S3, native AWS components to it. But the bulk of the cost is vmc running in AWS. Our contract will expire in May of 2025. So. So there is, you know, a sense of urgency to get off ahead of that, you know, because we can't go. You can't go on demand anymore.\nB: Yeah, yeah, definitely. So definitely not. Again, a unique situation. Lots of our customers are facing a similar challenge and are kind of making similar decisions here of doing that lift and shift, getting, getting out and kind of. So I think that one, it's not going to be an issue. Right. If it's not showing up. We can work with you all on quantifying that workload even if we're not seeing it currently running, you know, on or build via aws. So that's something that we could probably start a technical discovery on even if we're not seeing it build through AWS just yet. We would just need to work with you all on some sizing of the workload and doing some tagging. We might have to wait to like start the hands on lab component until it obviously until it's moved and lift and shifted over and we're seeing it, you know.\nD: And I think a combination Greg of rims, PCR Report Writer and RCM all certainly would push that over a million dollars if they're all very similar. Net SQL Server workloads.\nB: Yep.\nC: Yeah. Small in and of themselves, but together. I think you're right Rod, that they'll probably push that million dollar envelope.\nE: We also have the SQL Server modernization and if we can, you know, from all the easy to instances, about three of those. It's not a migration per se, but definitely upgrading and all that kind of thing is involved.\nB: Sorry, could you say that again? Or kind of.\nE: We have a. We have a few SQL Server systems which are on EC2 instances but dated editions, basically older editions. We want to upgrade and migrate to.\nD: RDs.\nE: Some of them potentially. So those are the things we are evaluating right now there are about three database servers in the CID world. They are a part of modernization because they are moving away from at least from a SQL Server database editions perspective, we'll be modernizing by upgrading them. Also moving to like an RDS infrastructure or like RDS custom infrastructure. So those are the considerations right now.\nC: And those are all standard edition, right Ranga?\nE: Yeah, they're all standard edition. There's no enterprise involved. We want to make it more, you know, right now it's all our management. So we want to get it to a place where we depend on AWS capabilities to support us on the management.\nB: Okay, sounds good, made a note of that as well as sort of other potential area for exploration and consideration here.\nD: So and then other application Greg had mentioned SSL is Spatial Stream is what we call it.\nB: Spatial Stream.\nD: Spatial Stream, yeah Spatial Stream got the.\nB: The acronym but didn't always good to refer back to it to things that.\nC: We'Ll send you the decoder ring.\nB: Everyone's got one. So okay, super. This is really helpful and again good conversations around the way that this would function. So it definitely sounds like you all are doing modernizations that are similar and things that we have seen before in aml. So again this is invite only. This offer, you know stands for you all based off of where you are in your modernization. Again, if you're interested in having a further conversation or digging into the RIMS application as well as the PCR and report writer. Really what we would do from there is do another sort of deeper dive on specifically those applications, quantifying the size of them and just kind of gathering some basic information pre technical discovery. And really if you all say jump, I say okay, I've got a solution architect. We can get them ready to go as soon as you all are ready to go. Kind of once we do that pre qualification just make sure we've got some details around the targeted workload. So that's really the way that this operates and that's the way that we can activate an aml. An application modernization lab engagement. Some other things to call out here as well is that we do have some resources and partnerships with the Gen AI Innovation center with aws. So if Gen AI is a priority for you all, we can always have conversations of if you've got use cases that you want to bring into the lab setting, sometimes we can do some really creative partnerships with them. Additionally, in terms of proserve staff augmentation, again, if you're not looking for all of the architectural support or the handholding of of teaching best practices and you really just want this to be, get in here, let's get some stuff done. Sometimes we've had success there, depending on the nature of the modernization you're all interested in exploring. So now wanted to give you all an overview of the financial outlay and the way that this operates because I think it's really important for everyone to understand how the cost neutrality functions and works. So there's really three core components to that 497k dollar amount. The first one's gonna be the architecting on aws course, that 15 to 30 seats. That's gonna be that three day teaching course for any of your engineers that are looking to work towards AWS certification. The second bid and the largest amount is gonna be that phase one Proserve Professional Services statement of work. That's approximately $437,000. That is something that is billed as you're working through the AML engagement and as you're actually getting that work done in lab. And the second or the third and final piece of it is what we call our AWS Countdown premium support mechanism. These are support engineers that as you move towards a heavy period of deployment in your modernization, an engineer would be allocated to you all for approximately 10 to 15 hours a week. They're specialists in the technologies that are a part of your target architecture and they're just there to embed with your teams to troubleshoot issues that you might be seeing respond in an expedited manner if there's anything that goes bump in the night during your deployment period and they've got specialized sort of access in terms of issue resolution and tools in their toolbox on the AWS side to help you all kind of troubleshoot any issues you're seeing in a deployment heavy period. Now the way that this works, I'm going to do a little bit of an outline of timing of an example of how cash would be moving in and out for you all. So the way this typically works, I'll give you a highlight of AWS invoice and billing when you can expect to pay it and then when you can expect the service credits to come back. First invoice comes through. It's a training, it's a training and certification invoice. It's that 15k for training. If you do that during the technical discovery or pre lab period, you would get that invoice and then we really adhere to any of your payment terms that are already aligned in terms of working with AWS. So for example, if we call it AP net terms 30, what you can expect is get your invoice kind of right at the start of the lab. You know, a month in you're going to get two things. One, you pay that invoice for the training that invoice a and then you would receive the invoice for the first half of your pro serve engagement approximately 219k. Move forward, conclude the lab, pay the first invoice for the pro serve pans on delivery, you'll receive the invoice for the second half of the proserve engagement. And now this is when that first service credit comes through for the customer where you get one, the training invoice is reimbursed back to you as well as the first half of the pro serve delivery. That's all coming back to you via service credits. They're applied. I manage the service credit process for my customers. So really all it is is a yep, you finished your lab paid that first invoice and I'm gonna issue the service credit. And you'll see it really in your billing console within one to two days of me requesting that service credit. So that's really the function of how the service credits work. Now Moving into the DIY phase, this post lab hands on lab phase one thing, you'll pay that second invoice, that's that second 219K for the Proserve delivery. And this is when you would start. You know, whenever you initiate that countdown premium support, it's going to be 7,500amonth and you'll receive service credits back to reimburse you for the hands on or sorry countdown premium Support Engineer every three months, 22,500 every three months to reimburse you back for that countdown engineer support. And you're like wait a second, I'm still out 219k. Where's that second service credit? That's a big number again. That's when you hit that modernization complete number where you would see the 219K come back to you that second service credit. As soon as we see the 75% deprecation of your legacy resources moved off of EC2 Windows or SQL Server, that's when you get that second service credit. And that's where it makes the fake cost neutral program. Now this is we like to walk people through this upfront because obviously it's a little bit complex the way that, that cash moves in and out. So we wanted to make sure everyone's transparent of the mechanisms through which cost neutrality is achieved. I will ask if anyone has any questions here, but I will also share this with you after this call. As well as a payment stream cash flow ledger Excel, which sometimes people like to do a little bit of a review and then and come back with questions as needed later. But do you want to cover this?\nC: Yeah. How, how does this, how does this relate to or how does it kind of dovetail with, with our EDP where we're going to renew our edp. And I, I guess I'm kind of in my head, I'm saying, okay, if it's cost neutral. Yeah, it's, you know, it kind of really shouldn't matter.\nB: Yeah.\nC: You know, I'm thinking the 497,000 in spend goes towards our EDP, but then the $497,000 in credits.\nB: Yeah, typically I would say that the cash flow of the AML program itself is not impactful for an EDP or kind of it's a net zero or the EDP initially. Something to consider is if you're expecting a cost optimization outcome for the modernization itself, it's something that's good to know about as you're considering EDP terms for the future. One, you can kind of view it as, oh, we expect to optimize x percent on this specific line item. But a lot of times what we see is customers leverage that either to reinvest, either fund additional migrations or for example, a lot of our customers, especially when doing database modernizations, are using it to, for example, invest in gen AI services so that they're still hitting their EDP commit. Or for example, a lot of our customers that are moving off of SQL Server, I've had some customers say, hey, we don't, we don't run this, we don't have a good VR strategy in terms of our database. So we want to actually, the savings that we'll get from our SQL modernization, we want to reinvest for some Dr. Capabilities or observability capabilities that we hadn't had before in our Aurora environment. So I've seen it kind of work out a couple of different ways. But that's more where I see the considerations on EDPs for annual customers is how do you want to manage your post modernized commitment?\nC: Makes sense.\nB: Great question. So, you know, in terms of sort of what's next is really going to be about looking at your your workloads and identifying, you know, an area that you're interested in modernizing. If this is an interesting program to you, I'm going to stop sharing. You know this deck right now. I do have what is called our AML Business Case tool and really what it is is it models out your optimization and kind of modernization opportunities for your current EC2 windows and you know, SQL server footprint running on AWS. So the rims probably won't show up in that. But you know it does give you some idea of what the opportunity looks like. Do you all want to kind of take a look at that for the last 10 minutes or are there some questions that you all maybe have about the way that AML works?\nC: I actually just had one question on the training part.\nA: So we have already done that class. We also currently have active skill builder as well. So not really quite sure how that plays in if that would potentially just get credited back because we're already doing it or is that an additional requirement.\nC: Then like how does that work?\nB: So what we've done in the past is sometimes customers that have already completed that class will opt for a different three day training that is maybe more relevant or a higher level for their engineers to complete. So any three day course that is of similar value can be used in place of the architecting with aws. And if there is not one that is useful then typically what we'll do is just do a zero dollar sort of immersion day for preparation in terms of skill building. So you know, I think I can share with you all the similar courses that can be taken in place place of the architecting with AWS class and see if there's one that that kind of sticks out to you all. Or we can have conversations, you know, if that's not a useful use of time for your engineers, let's have a conversation about that too to find a better Got it, got it.\nA: Okay. Appreciate it. One note on the on the EDP or cross service PPAP the so I was just thinking through the pro serve so the pro serve falls outside the edp. Anyways I just wanted to clarify that so like typically doesn't get the EDP discount and does not count against EDP spend. So as we talk about forecasting going like cost savings like definitely need to take those into account from a demand planning perspective. But the we don't have to say okay well you know we don't have to worry about the cost neutrality and whether or not we should factor the pro serve into the commitment for next year and so on like that we can't do that anyways even if we wanted to from a pro serve perspective.\nC: Okay, yeah, I agree. But the pro serve, the credits we're going to be receiving back though won't negatively. Those will be taken out of the equation for the. Right. So the $500,497,000 in spend doesn't count towards, towards our buy down of the edp. I just want to make sure that any credits we then subsequently receive wound penalize us in our edp.\nB: Yeah, that's right. Correct.\nA: Correct. Yeah. I mean I and I should, as we go through the ADP planning process, we'll take a closer look at it too. But yeah, that's. That's correct. And then I was trying to think through for a second whether I could imagine any scenario where it would negatively impact you and I can't. So yeah, we would be good on that front is my understanding.\nB: Yeah.\nC: So we just need to figure out the cost optimization. So if we're going to be end up saving over the course of the three years, you know, $300,000 would have to factor that in.\nA: Yeah. Especially as it, you know, obviously a conversation for a different call but especially as it if we get closer down to low growth, you know, from that kind of 20% number we've talked about. Right. Which is like we're coming quite a bit lower than that. I think we'll have to be really careful because you know we've talked about the difficulty of the negative growth approval. So I think that is kind of the piece we'll have to make sure we talk about going forward.\nD: Yeah.\nB: It'S a, actually a good segue. I will share with you all sort of our business case tool outputs because you know, might give some idea of what optimizations could look like depending again this is purely done as with some high level assumptions and not we would want to have continued conversations with you all to really model this based off your specific use case. But what you see here, and this is again just based off of your current EC2, Windows SQL, RDS, FSX, Windows EC2, SQL Server, all of those workloads currently running in AWS. So RIM's not going to be showing up here but right now what we're seeing is about 1.7 million annually spent on those workloads and really what we're seeing based off of our general modeling and what we've seen with previous modernizations for customers with similar workloads is a potential 72% cost optimization of those workloads. Now, again, that assumes you touch every single box that's associated with your estate. And the modernization pathways kind of follow the modernization pathways we talked about. So your biggest opportunity here is definitely the EC2 to Linux boxes modernization pathway. Would be interested to understand what percentage of that would be tied potentially to your applications that you're interested in modernizing and the application code itself versus anything tied to your databases. But the other opportunities here, obviously SQL RDS is another huge modernization opportunity. It represents about 31% of your modernization footprint, again not including rims or anything that's in migration. And then FSX Windows is another big one, which is probably tied to your BYOL usage as well.\nC: Does the SQL Server and EC2 costs include storage? Does the RDS include database storage and EC2 include EDS?\nB: It does not include EBS, no.\nC: Okay, so that's strictly compute. That's strictly compute, yeah, it's all compute. And I think what you're going to, what we're going to find as we get into this, at least on the SQL Server side, and I think in the case it's also going to be on the easy to that a big portion of that spend is going to be limited to a small group of instances. I mean, we've got one of our most costly resources is a SQL Server for that spatial stream application. We've got a couple of significantly large SQL servers that are associated with that. So it's not kind of like a. There's not really an equal balance going on. We'll have to look at the big hitters here.\nB: Yeah, makes sense. And what we see is if you're looking at just your EC2 Windows usage. So it's really going to be these are your top workloads or account IDs that are associated. So EDR lock data are going to be your two primary ones driving just the EC2 Windows usage. It doesn't reflect your SQL Server or, sorry, your SQL RDS and FSX Windows usage here. But that's what we're seeing based off of your current usage patterns are really kind of driving, at least by nature.\nC: Of how we set things up originally or in that EDR account that's going to be changing. Rob's under, you know, he's running a program right now, going to be moving to a more distributed, you know, best practice type of account architecture. So that EDR in the near future is going to get distributed out. But right now it just happens that probably a good 90% of all of our workloads happen to be in that EDR account.\nB: Yep. Okay, gotcha. It makes a lot of sense. Yeah. So look, I think that what we would want to do probably is kind of understand from you all is where can AML provide the biggest lift? Is it talking about the rims, PCR and report writer? Is it talking Raja, is it talking a little bit about your SQL modernization and if there's opportunities to introduce Aurora or other non SQL based products? Definitely understand that the licensing piece is is a complexity for some customers and there are some licenses that can't go away or ones that are already sort of used. Definitely hear you on the functionality side for the geospatial or you know, usage and geographic usage activity for the SQL functions as well. So you know, I think for us we wanted to introduce this program, let you know this is available to you for things that are running on AWS and if there is an opportunity to support things that are coming over to aws. So what I can do knowing that we're at time right now, is share with you all the materials we reviewed today, including the first call deck. I can also share with you this business case tool as well as the account workload profile worksheet which really just gives the breakdown of the EC2 Windows workload. We refer to that as the AWPW. It's a super sexy name we know. But so what I can do is share with this information with you all. Take a noodle on it, think about it, think where there's, you know, best opportunities to leverage this. But we wanted to make sure you were aware of this invite only program.\nD: Awesome. Thank you so much.\nC: Yeah, thank you. This is great.\nA: Appreciate it.\nB: Yeah, thank you all, really appreciate it. Cheers.\nA: Thanks Jackie. Thanks everybody.",
